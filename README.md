# Hangman Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the Hangman Game! This project is a Rust implementation of the classic word guessing game, developed by a Java developer (yours truly) to explore new technologies and broaden my programming horizons. 

Hangman is a fun and interactive game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. With this Rust version, you can experience the thrill of Hangman while also getting a taste of Rust's performance and expressive power.

## Features
- Random word selection: The game selects a word from a pre-defined list of words, ensuring each game is unique.
- User input: Enter your guesses by typing a letter and pressing enter. The game will inform you if the letter is correct or not.
- Feedback and scoring: The game provides feedback on the correctness of each guess and maintains a score based on your performance.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Hangman Game, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download it from the official Rust website: [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org).

2. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pelzerlukas/hangman.git
   ```


3. **Play the game**: Navigate to the project directory and run the game using the `cargo` command:
   ```
   cargo run
   ```

5. **Enjoy the Hangman Game!**: You are now ready to play Hangman in Rust. Follow the prompts and have fun guessing the hidden word!
